Introduction
============

Delphi is an AutoML system designed with ease of use in mind.
Typically a Machine Learning algorithm has parameters that must be tuned.
Delphi, like many other AutoML systems, abstracts this tuning sequence away from the end user.
Delphi takes in data with pre-extracted feature vectors and labels in a simple CSV file format.
In the end, Delphi returns the best classifier with parameters for a particular input feature set.
There are still some parameters, but they are of a more intuitive nature (*e.g.*, maximum number of classifier runs, metric of performance, *etc.*).
